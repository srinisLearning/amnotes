Sure, I'd be happy to explain `for`, `of`, and `forEach` loops in TypeScript with examples.

**1. `for` Loop:**
The `for` loop is a traditional loop that iterates over a range of values. It's commonly used when you know the exact number of iterations you want to perform.

Example:
```typescript
// Using a for loop to iterate over an array
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

**2. `for...of` Loop:**
The `for...of` loop is a more modern loop that is used specifically for iterating over elements of an iterable (e.g., arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.). It provides a cleaner syntax and is especially useful when you want to focus on the values rather than indices.

Example:
```typescript
// Using a for...of loop to iterate over an array
const fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
```

**3. `forEach` Loop:**
The `forEach` loop is a method provided by arrays in JavaScript and TypeScript. It iterates over the elements of an array and allows you to pass a callback function to perform an operation on each element. This is especially useful for applying the same operation to every element.

Example:
```typescript
// Using forEach loop to iterate over an array
const animals: string[] = ["cat", "dog", "elephant"];
animals.forEach((animal) => {
    console.log(animal);
});
```

**Note:** In TypeScript, you can also specify the data type of the elements explicitly:

```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using for loop
for (let i: number = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}

// Using for...of loop
for (const num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}

// Using forEach loop
numbers.forEach((num: number) => {
    console.log(num);
});
```

All three loop constructs allow you to iterate over elements, but they have different use cases. The `for` loop is suitable when you need to control the iteration explicitly, the `for...of` loop is more concise and suitable for iterating over iterable elements, and the `forEach` loop is great for applying a function to each element of an array.
