What is a Funnel
In digital marketing, a funnel refers to the path that a potential customer takes from initially becoming aware of a product or service to ultimately making a purchase. The funnel is often depicted as an inverted pyramid, with the widest part at the top representing the initial stage of awareness and the narrowest part at the bottom representing the final stage of purchase.
The funnel is typically divided into several stages, including:

1. Awareness: This is the stage where potential customers first become aware of a product or service through various marketing channels, such as social media, search engines, or advertising.

2. Interest: At this stage, potential customers have shown some interest in the product or service and are looking for more information. They may visit the company's website, read reviews, or engage with the brand on social media

3. Consideration: At this stage, potential customers are actively considering whether or not to purchase the product or service. They may be comparing prices, features, and reviews with other similar products.

4. Conversion: This is the final stage, where potential customers become paying customers by making a purchase.
By understanding the different stages of the funnel, digital marketers can create targeted campaigns and content that addresses the specific needs and interests of potential customers at each stage, with the ultimate goal of driving conversions and sales.
