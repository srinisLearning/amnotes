In Facebook Ads, saved audiences, custom audiences, and lookalike audiences are all tools you can use to target specific groups of people with your ads. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. Saved Audiences: A saved audience is a group of people you can save and reuse for future ad campaigns. You can create a saved audience based on various criteria, such as age, gender, location, interests, behaviors, and more. You can also create a saved audience from your customer list, website traffic, or engagement on your Facebook Page or app.

2. Custom Audiences: A custom audience is a group of people you've already connected with in some way, such as your email list, mobile app users, or people who've interacted with your Facebook Page or app. You can use custom audiences to create more targeted and personalized ads for these people.

3. Lookalike Audiences: A lookalike audience is a group of people who are similar to a custom audience you've created. Facebook uses machine learning algorithms to identify people who are most likely to be interested in your business based on the characteristics of the custom audience you've created. You can use lookalike audiences to reach new people who are likely to be interested in your products or services.
Each type of audience has its own unique benefits, and you can use a combination of them to reach your desired target audience. For example, you can create a lookalike audience based on your best customers, then use a saved audience to exclude people who've already made a purchase in the past 30 days.
