Funnel Types
In digital marketing, a funnel refers to the path that a potential customer takes from initially becoming aware of a product or service to ultimately making a purchase. The funnel is often depicted as an inverted pyramid, with the widest part at the top representing the initial stage of awareness and the narrowest part at the bottom representing the final stage of purchase.
