NLP is a branch of artifical intelligance that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. ChatGPT emplyos advanced NLP algorithms to understand and generate human like text based on the input it receives.

A Prompt is a specific instruction or cue given to a computer program, particulaly in the context of natural language processing (NLP). In the case of language models like ChatGPT, a prompt is a piece of text provided to the model to initiate a conversation or generate a response.

Prompt Engineering refers to the process of designing and refining prompts to elicit specific responses or behaviors from a language model, such as ChatGPT. It involves crafting prompts that are clear, specific and tailored to the desired task or outcome
